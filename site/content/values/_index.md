      The Barracuda is our version of a high-performance four fin fish, with
      more short board feeling rails and a thinned out tail! This board glides
      like a fish and explodes and reacts like your normal short board. The
      quad-fin set up holds a higher line in the more critical part of the wave.
      The Barracuda gives you the best of both worlds. - David Vernor

      Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic
      origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans
      from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it
      was grown to whatever degree available.

      Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an
      understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between
      organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are
      a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.
